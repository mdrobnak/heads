Boards under this directory were moved from UNTESTED_ to UNMAINTAINED_ automatically since untested for a while.
Boards not having UNMAINTAINED in their names are not compliant with current build system (linuxboot) and need reupstreaming.

To test those boards, move them to boards directory and follow normal build operations, test builds on boards and open an issue stating you are willing to test those when builds are made available from CircleCI in the future.
